# Webpack Setup for React.js

Mininal Webpack and React.js Starter boilerplate.

## Why?

- The alternative for CRA is to set up your own boilerplate;
- We can eliminate all of its disadvantages by setting up dependencies and configs by ourselves (you can add dependencies as per your requirement) and easier to add/modify build configs;
- Minimal webpack and babel configs required to run a react application;
- Production-ready build set up, with linters and pre-commit hooks.
- Support for both JSX and TSX;

## Usage

Create a new application using `create-react-app` with the `-e | --example` flag pointing to this repository's url, like so:

```bash
npx create-react-app project-name -e https://github.com/fariasmateuss/webpack-setup-for-react.git
```

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fariasmateuss/webpack-setup-for-react.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd webpack-setup-for-react
```

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Start the server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

That's it. Changes to components should hot-reload in the browser.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
yarn build
```

## Scripts

- Start dev server using `yarn dev`.
- Build and bundling your resources for production `yarn build`.
- Deploy it to GitHub pages using `yarn deploy`
- `yarn type-check` validate code using TypeScript compiler.
- `yarn lint` and `yarn format` to run ESLint and Prettier for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn commit` run commitizen. Alternative to `git commit`.

## Switch to npm

By default, this boilerplate uses Yarn 1 (Classic), but this choice is yours. If you'd like to switch to npm, delete the `yarn.lock` file, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and change the CI workflows, Husky Git hooks, and lint-staged steps to use npm commands.
